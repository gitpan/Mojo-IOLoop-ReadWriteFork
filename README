NAME
    Mojo::IOLoop::ReadWriteFork - Fork a process and read/write from it

VERSION
    0.03

DESCRIPTION
    This class enable you to fork children which you can write data to and
    emit events when the child prints to STDERR or STDOUT.

    Patches that enable the "read" event to see the difference between
    STDERR and STDOUT are more than welcome.

SYNOPSIS
  Standalone
      my $fork = Mojo::IOLoop::ReadWriteFork->new;
      my $cat_result = '';

      $fork->on(error => sub {
        my($fork, $error) = @_;
        warn $error;
      });
      $fork->on(close => sub {
        my($fork, $exit_value, $signal) = @_;
        warn "got close event";
        Mojo::IOLoop->stop;
      });
      $fork->on(read => sub {
        my($fork, $buffer) = @_; # $buffer = both STDERR and STDOUT
        $cat_result .= $buffer;
      });

      $fork->start(
        program => 'cat',
        program_args => [ '-' ],
        conduit => 'pty',
      );

    ple/tail.pl>.

EVENTS
  close
    Emitted when the child process exit.

  error
    Emitted when when the there is an issue with creating, writing or
    reading from the child process.

  read
    Emitted when the child has written a chunk of data to STDOUT or STDERR.

ATTRIBUTES
  pid
    Holds the child process ID.

  reactor
    Holds a Mojo::Reactor object. Default is:

      Mojo::IOLoop->singleton->reactor;

METHODS
  start
      $self->start(
        program => $str,
        program_args => [@str],
        conduit => $str, # pipe or pty
        raw => $bool,
        clone_winsize_from => \*STDIN,
      );

    Used to fork and exec a child process.

    raw and "clone_winsize_from|IO::Pty" only makes sense if "conduit" is
    "pty".

  write
      $self->write($buffer);

    Used to write data to the child process.

  kill
      $bool = $self->kill;
      $bool = $self->kill(15); # default

    Used to signal the child.
